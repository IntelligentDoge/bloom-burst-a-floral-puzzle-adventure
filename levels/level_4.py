Okay, here's a concept for a new level in Bloom Burst, designed to be fun, balanced, and introduce a new challenging element:

**Level Name:** "Sunset Serenade"

**Difficulty:** Intermediate-Hard

**New Element Introduction:**  **Creepers (Obstacles)** - These thorny vines slowly spread across the grid, consuming flower spaces. Players must strategically place flowers to block their growth or use a new "Pruning Shears" tool to temporarily clear them.

**Level Objective:** Fulfill the following order:

*   **Arrangement Size:** 7x7 Grid
*   **Flower Count:**
    *   Sunflowers: Minimum 8
    *   Lavender: Minimum 6
    *   Crimson Roses: Minimum 4
*   **Color Harmony:**
    *   Golden Ratio Rule: Arrangement must generally follow the Golden Ratio in flower placement - this means clusters of flowers should be placed and sized according to this mathematical concept for visual balance. The game will highlight areas that satisfy or violate the Golden Ratio rule to help players.
*   **Symmetry:** Arrangement must have at least two-fold rotational symmetry around the central grid space.
*   **Obstacle Management:** Keep creeper coverage below 10 squares by the time the order is complete.

**Level Layout:**

```
. . . . . . .
. C . . . . .
. . . . . . .
. . . # . . .
. . . . . C .
. . . . . . .
. . . . . . .
```

Key:

*   `.` = Empty Grid Space
*   `C` = Creeper Start Location (2 locations diagonally opposite)
*   `#` = Pre-placed Sunflower (Center of the grid)

**Flower Availability:**

*   Sunflowers
*   Lavender
*   Crimson Roses
*   (Unlocked from previous level)  White Lilies (limited quantity: 3) â€“ these provide a large bloom area and can help block Creepers.

**Tool Availability:**

*   Drag & Drop
*   Rotation
*   **New: Pruning Shears (Limited Use: 3)** - Clears Creepers from a 2x2 area.

**Gameplay Strategy/Guide**

1.  **Early Game:** Start by placing Sunflowers strategically around the pre-placed Sunflower to establish a base. Prioritize areas furthest from the Creeper Start Locations. Utilize the White Lilies around the pre-placed sunflower, as they bloom in a larger area.

2.  **Creeper Management:**  Constantly monitor the Creeper growth.  Use the Pruning Shears strategically on Creeper clusters that are about to block important areas for Sunflower placement. Lavender flowers can be helpful for slowing down creeper growth, as their bloom radius is small and dense.

3.  **Color Harmony (Golden Ratio):**  The game will provide visual cues indicating areas where the Golden Ratio is satisfied. Think about creating clusters of flowers that follow this pattern. Bigger clusters can be placed to the far left and right side of the grid to help balance the single sunflower in the middle.

4.  **Symmetry:** As you place flowers, keep the rotational symmetry objective in mind.  It might be useful to imagine folding the arrangement along the grid's horizontal and vertical axes to ensure symmetry. Focus on placing matching flower types in symmetrical locations around the center.

5.  **Late Game:** Once you have a good foundation and Creeper growth is under control, focus on filling in remaining spaces with Lavender and Crimson Roses to meet the flower count requirements.  Fine-tune the arrangement to maximize the Golden Ratio score.

**Challenge & Balance Notes:**

*   **Creeper Growth Speed:**  The speed is moderate, requiring active management but not overwhelming the player. The speed can be adjusted for playtesting.
*   **Limited Pruning Shears:**  Forces players to make strategic decisions about when and where to use them.
*   **Golden Ratio Implementation:**  The game's hint system should be clear and easy to understand. Perhaps a highlight changes color intensity based on how closely an area follows the Golden Ratio.
*   **Symmetry Requirement:** Rotational symmetry adds another layer of complexity, requiring players to think about the overall balance of their arrangement.
*   **Pre-placed Sunflower:**  Provides a starting point and simplifies the early game somewhat, but also adds constraints that players must work around.

**Scoring:**

*   Base score for fulfilling the order.
*   Bonus score for exceeding the minimum flower counts.
*   Bonus score for minimizing Creeper coverage below the 10-square limit.
*   Bonus score for maximizing adherence to the Golden Ratio (the closer to the perfect ratio, the better).
*   Time Bonus (if Challenge Mode is enabled)

**Why This Level Is Fun & Balanced:**

*   **New Mechanic:** The Creepers introduce a new challenge that forces players to adapt their strategies.
*   **Strategic Decisions:** Players must carefully consider flower placement, Creeper management, and adherence to the Golden Ratio and Symmetry rules.
*   **Visual Appeal:**  The combination of Sunflowers, Lavender, Crimson Roses, and White Lilies creates a visually stunning arrangement, especially when the Golden Ratio is applied effectively.
*   **Clear Objectives:** The objectives are clearly defined, allowing players to focus on achieving them.
*   **Meaningful Choices:**  Every flower placement and Pruning Shears use has a direct impact on the player's success.
*   **Reward for Mastery:**  Successfully balancing all the elements of the level leads to a high score and a sense of accomplishment.

**Further Refinements (Playtesting):**

*   Adjust Creeper growth speed.
*   Fine-tune flower availability and the number of Pruning Shears.
*   Refine the Golden Ratio hint system for clarity.
*   Test different initial Creeper placement configurations.

This level should provide a satisfying and challenging experience for Bloom Burst players!
