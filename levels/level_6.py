Okay, here's a complete level design for Bloom Burst, focusing on introducing the concept of "Specialty Blooms" and arrangement asymmetry challenges:

**Level Title:** Whispers of the Waterfall

**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Level Objective:** Fulfill the Gardener's Order: Create a cascading floral arrangement with a prominent "Water Lily of Purity," exhibiting balanced asymmetry and utilizing the "Blue Harmony" color palette. (Target Score: 850 Points)

**Level Layout:**

*   **Grid Size:** 8x8 (slightly larger than previous levels, allowing for more complex arrangements)
*   **Background:** A serene vista of a gentle waterfall cascading into a pool, with lush greenery surrounding the playable grid area.  Ambient sounds of water and birdsong.
*   **Pre-Placed Elements:**
    *   **Top Row (Row 1):** Pre-placed "Trailing Vines" Obstacle (see details below) in tiles (1,1), (4,1), and (7,1). These occupy a single tile and cannot be moved or bloomed through.  They visually "hang" down, partially obstructing the grid.
    *   **Center Tile (4,4):**  A bonus +50 point 'Dewdrop'.

**Flower Types Available:**

*   **Classic Bloom:** (Unlocked in prior levels) Basic 1x1 flower, good for filling space. Comes in Pink, White, Blue and Yellow.
*   **Trailing Vine:** (New element) A 1x1 obstacle that cant be removed.
*   **Bluebell Cluster:** (Unlocked in prior levels) 1x2 L-shaped flower. Blooms a wider area.  Comes in Blue.
*   **Lily Pad:** (Unlocked in prior levels) 2x2 flower, provides a large bloom area. Comes in White.
*   **Water Lily of Purity:** (New Flower - Specialty Bloom!) A 2x2 square flower.  This flower is crucial for completing the order. It *must* be placed in the arrangement and contribute to the bloom. Only comes in White. The Water Lily gives a large bloom radius.

**New Game Mechanic: Specialty Blooms**

*   Specialty Blooms are unique flower types that often contribute heavily to the level objective. They may have special properties or bloom effects.
*   The Water Lily of Purity, for example, grants a significant bonus to "Arrangement Harmony" if placed symmetrically (however, the objective requires asymmetry, forcing a trade-off).

**Obstacles and Challenges:**

*   **Trailing Vines:** As mentioned, these are pre-placed obstacles. They obstruct placement, forcing players to plan around them. They are indestructible and cannot be bloomed through.
*   **Color Restrictions:** The "Blue Harmony" palette limits flower choices and encourages strategic placement of Bluebell Clusters to maximize bloom coverage. Pink and Yellow flowers will only provide a 1/2 bloom. White flowers provide a 3/4 bloom. Blue Flowers provide a Full Bloom.
*   **Asymmetry Requirement:** The Gardener's Order specifically demands balanced asymmetry. This means the arrangement cannot be perfectly mirrored along any axis.  Too much symmetry will result in a penalty to the final score. A visual "Asymmetry Meter" is displayed, indicating the degree of symmetry and providing feedback on how to adjust the arrangement.

**Collectible Items:**

*   **Dewdrop (4,4):** +50 points. Located in a central tile, rewarding players for a focused early strategy.
*   **Hidden Dewdrops:** Two additional Dewdrops (+25 points each) are hidden beneath specific flower placement locations.  For example, placing a Bluebell Cluster on tiles (3,6) and (4,6) might reveal a hidden Dewdrop underneath (randomized upon level start for replayability). This encourages exploration and experimentation.

**Scoring System:**

*   **Bloom Score:** Based on the area covered by blooming flowers.  Larger flowers and strategic placement yield higher bloom scores.
*   **Color Harmony Bonus:** Achieving the "Blue Harmony" palette target adds a bonus (e.g., +100 points).
*   **Asymmetry Score:**  A score based on the Asymmetry Meter. Achieving the sweet spot of balanced asymmetry yields the maximum points (e.g., +150 points). Too much or too little asymmetry reduces the score.
*   **Time Bonus (Challenge Mode Only):**  Remaining time converted to bonus points.
*   **Dewdrop Bonus:** Collecting Dewdrops adds to the overall score.

**Level Flow and Strategy Tips:**

1.  **Initial Assessment:**  Players should immediately assess the placement of the Trailing Vines and plan around them. Consider how they will impact flower placement and bloom patterns.
2.  **Water Lily Placement:**  Decide where to place the Water Lily of Purity *early*.  Its 2x2 size dictates a significant portion of the arrangement.  Remember, it *must* be used, and its placement will affect the Asymmetry Meter.
3.  **Bluebell Cluster Strategy:** Use the Bluebell Clusters to maximize bloom coverage in the "Blue Harmony" palette. Their L-shape allows for strategic filling of gaps and extending bloom ranges.
4.  **Achieving Asymmetry:** Experiment with flower placement to create a visually appealing but asymmetrical arrangement. Avoid placing identical flowers in mirrored positions. Consider using different flower types to balance the composition.
5.  **Hidden Dewdrops:** Experiment with different flower placement combinations, especially in areas with open grid space, to uncover the hidden Dewdrops and maximize score.

**Level Completion:**

*   The level is completed when the player confirms the arrangement and submits it for scoring.
*   The game calculates the Bloom Score, Color Harmony Bonus, Asymmetry Score, and any Dewdrop bonuses.
*   The player receives a star rating based on their final score, with 3 stars indicating mastery of the level.
*   A replay option is presented for players to attempt to improve their score or experiment with different strategies.

**Zen Mode Modification:**

*   In Zen Mode, the time limit is removed. The objective remains the same, but players can take their time to perfect the arrangement without pressure. The Asymmetry Meter provides feedback, but there's no score penalty for exceeding or falling short of the ideal asymmetry.

**Challenge Mode Modification:**

*   Challenge Mode introduces a time limit for completing the Gardener's Order.
*   A visible timer counts down, adding pressure and requiring players to make quick decisions.
*   A scoring multiplier is applied to all points earned based on the remaining time.
*   Leaderboard integration allows players to compete for the highest scores.

**Visual Design Notes:**

*   The "Water Lily of Purity" should have a visually distinct and elegant design. Perhaps a subtle shimmering effect to highlight its importance.
*   The "Trailing Vines" should look natural and organic, but also clearly communicate their obstruction role.
*   The "Asymmetry Meter" should be clear and intuitive, providing real-time feedback on the arrangement's symmetry. Use color-coding (e.g., green for balanced, yellow for slightly unbalanced, red for severely unbalanced) to make it easily understandable.
* The waterfall background should create a sense of calm and tranquility.

This level design aims to provide a balanced and engaging experience, introducing new mechanics and challenges while remaining true to the core gameplay of Bloom Burst. The "Water Lily of Purity" adds a strategic element, and the asymmetry requirement forces players to think creatively about their floral arrangements. Good luck with implementing it!
