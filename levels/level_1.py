Okay, here's a complete level design for Bloom Burst, focusing on introducing a new obstacle and leveraging a specific color combination for challenge.

**Level Title:** "Sunset Harmony"

**Theme:** This level is themed around warm, autumnal colors and balanced arrangements, evoking the feeling of a serene sunset.

**New Element Introduction:** **Thorn Patch:** A 1x1 tile that prevents flower placement.  If a flower is dragged over a Thorn Patch, it wilts and is removed from the player's inventory. Thorn Patches can be removed by using the "Gardening Gloves" tool (assuming this is unlocked earlier in the game).

**Level Layout:**

*   **Grid Size:** 7x7

*   **Initial Flower Inventory:**
    *   3 x Sunset Roses (2x2, Orange/Red)
    *   3 x Goldenrod (1x1, Yellow)
    *   2 x Crimson Asters (1x1, Red/Purple)
    *   1 x Canary Cosmos (2x2, Yellow)
*   **Starting Tool Inventory:** 2 x Gardening Gloves

*   **Grid Layout (using coordinates, top left is 1,1):**

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 . . . . . . .
2 . T . . . T .
3 . . . . . . .
4 . . . . . . .
5 . . . . . . .
6 . T . . . T .
7 . . . . . . .
```

*   `T` represents a Thorn Patch.  `.` represents an empty tile.

**Objective:**

*   **Primary Objective:** Create an arrangement with *at least* 12 Yellow floral segments, *at least* 10 Red floral segments, and a *perfectly symmetrical* arrangement across the vertical axis (column 4).
*   **Bonus Objective:** Use all available flowers in the inventory.
*   **Hidden Objective (for extra scoring multiplier):** Position all yellow flowers (Goldenrod and Canary Cosmos) so that no two yellow flowers are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically).

**Enemy Placements:** (Bloom Burst is a relaxing game, so enemies here are more "annoyances" that can be handled with strategy)

*   **Wilted Weed (Placement 1,1):**  A 1x1 "weed" that's automatically placed in a random empty grid space after the player makes 3 moves. Removing it consumes a move (and potentially a flower if you're not careful).  It only spawns once in this level. The wilted weed will not spawn on tiles occupied by other flowers or in thorn patches.

**Collectible Items:**

*   **Hidden Seed Packet (Appears at position 4,4 after player successfully places 4 flowers):** Grants +1 to the score multiplier.
*   **Gardening Gloves (Randomly appear if player runs out before completing the level):** The number of Gardening Gloves available to be found will depend on the difficulty of the level (ie. easy=3 gloves, med=2 gloves, hard=1 glove).

**Obstacles and Challenges:**

*   **Thorn Patches:** Restrict initial placement options, forcing players to use Gardening Gloves strategically.  Their placement on the 2nd and 6th rows forces players to consider symmetrical positioning early on.
*   **Symmetry Requirement:** The requirement for perfect vertical symmetry is the core challenge of the level.  Players must carefully consider the placement of each flower to ensure it has a mirrored counterpart on the opposite side of the vertical axis.
*   **Color Combination:** The requirement for both Yellow and Red floral segments forces players to balance the use of different flower types and to plan placement to maximize color adjacency (for potentially higher scores, if color adjacency is part of the core scoring system).
*   **Limited Inventory:** The relatively small flower inventory requires efficient use of space.

**Gameplay Strategy & Level Flow:**

1.  **Initial Assessment:** Players will immediately need to assess the Thorn Patch locations and their flower inventory.
2.  **Thorn Patch Removal:** Decide which Thorn Patches to remove, bearing in mind the symmetry objective.  Prioritize whichever patch gives the best starting position for the 2x2 Sunset Roses or Canary Cosmos.
3.  **Strategic Placement:** Begin placing the larger Sunset Roses and Canary Cosmos first.  This establishes the basic framework for the arrangement and dictates the subsequent placement of the smaller Goldenrod and Crimson Asters. Careful consideration of color adjacency is crucial.
4.  **Symmetry Management:**  Every move must be made with symmetry in mind. Asymmetrical placements are difficult to recover from.
5.  **Filling Gaps:** Use Goldenrod and Crimson Asters to fill gaps, complete color requirements, and potentially trigger bonus scoring opportunities (if color adjacency is a scoring mechanic).
6.  **Inventory Management:**  Carefully manage flower placement to avoid wasting any.  The bonus objective requires using all flowers.
7.  **Wilted Weed Mitigation:** When the Wilted Weed spawns, deal with it efficiently.

**Scoring:**

*   Base score awarded for completing the Primary Objective.
*   Bonus score for completing the Bonus Objective (using all flowers).
*   Multiplier applied for completing the Hidden Objective (no adjacent yellow flowers).
*   Additional points for color adjacency, flower size, and arrangement complexity (based on existing scoring system).
*   Time bonus (if Challenge Mode is active).
*   Penalty if thorns are not removed before using other flower.

**Why this is a good level:**

*   **Introduces a New Mechanic:** The Thorn Patch is a new obstacle that adds a layer of strategic planning.
*   **Challenges Strategic Thinking:** The symmetry requirement and color combination objective demand careful placement and foresight.
*   **Balanced Difficulty:** The limited inventory and obstacle placement create a challenge without being overly frustrating.
*   **Encourages Experimentation:**  The open grid and varied flower types allow for different approaches to solving the puzzle.
*   **Reinforces Core Mechanics:** The level leverages existing scoring and flower placement mechanics, solidifying the player's understanding of the game.
*   **Visually Appealing:** The color theme evokes a calming and visually pleasing atmosphere.
*   **Clear Objectives:** The objectives are clearly defined, giving the player a concrete goal to strive for.

This level provides a balanced and enjoyable experience that will challenge players while reinforcing their understanding of the core mechanics of Bloom Burst.  Good luck!
