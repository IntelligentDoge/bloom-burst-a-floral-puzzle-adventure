Okay, let's craft a detailed development plan for 'Bloom Burst: A Floral Puzzle Adventure'.

**1. Overall Game Architecture:**

We'll employ a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.  This separation ensures code maintainability, scalability, and testability.

*   **Model:**  Handles the game's data, rules, and logic.  It represents the game state, including flower types, grid state, order requirements, player score, unlocked items, and any persistent data.
*   **View:**  Responsible for presenting the game to the user.  This includes drawing the grid, flowers, UI elements, animations, and visual feedback. It reacts to changes in the Model.
*   **Controller:**  Handles user input, translates it into commands, and updates the Model accordingly.  It acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model.

**2. Key Files and Modules:**

We'll structure the project into several files/modules for organization.  The exact file names can be modified as needed.

*   **Core Game Logic (Model):**
    *   `Flower.py`:  Defines the `Flower` class.  Attributes include:
        *   `flower_type` (e.g., "Rose", "Lily", "Tulip"): String representing the flower type.  This will map to visual assets and unlockable properties.
        *   `color` (e.g., "Red", "Yellow", "Pink", "Purple", "White"): String representing the flower's color.
        *   `size` (e.g., "Small", "Medium", "Large"): String representing the flower's size.  Affects grid placement and score.
        *   `bloom_level` (e.g., 1-5): Integer representing the flower's bloom stage. Influences visual appearance.  Can be used for future upgrades/mechanics.
        *   `rotation` (0, 90, 180, 270): Integer representing the rotation of the flower in degrees.
    *   `Grid.py`:  Defines the `Grid` class.  Attributes include:
        *   `grid_size` (e.g., 6x6, 8x8):  Defines the dimensions of the grid.
        *   `grid_data`:  A 2D array (list of lists) representing the grid's state. Each cell can contain a `Flower` object or be empty (None).
        *   `isValidMove(flower, x, y)`:  A function to validate that a move is valid within the grid.
        *   `placeFlower(flower, x, y)`:  A function to place the flower in the grid.
        *   `removeFlower(x,y)`: A function to remove a flower from the grid
        *   `getFlowerAt(x,y)`: A function that gets the flower at a given coordinate.
    *   `Order.py`:  Defines the `Order` class.  Attributes include:
        *   `order_id`:  Unique identifier for the order.
        *   `requirements`:  A dictionary specifying the requirements for fulfilling the order.  Examples:
            *   `"red_flowers"`: 3 (Requires 3 red flowers)
            *   `"symmetry"`: True (Requires symmetrical arrangement)
            *   `"min_score"`: 500 (Requires a minimum score of 500)
            *   `"color_palette"`: ["Red", "Yellow", "Orange"] (Requires only these colours)
        *   `reward`:  A dictionary specifying the reward for completing the order.
            *   `"coins"`: 100
            *   `"unlock_flower"`: "Sunflower"
    *   `GameManager.py`: Central class for managing the game state.
        *   `current_grid`: Instance of the `Grid` class.
        *   `current_order`: Instance of the `Order` class.
        *   `player_score`: Integer representing the player's score.
        *   `player_inventory`:  A list of unlocked flowers and tools.
        *   `available_flowers`: A list of flowers the player can drag and drop on this level.
        *   `isOrderComplete()`:  A function to check if the current order is complete.
        *   `calculateScore()`:  A function to calculate the player's score based on the arrangement.
        *   `applyReward()`:  A function to apply the reward for completing an order.
        *   `loadLevel(level_id)`:  Loads a level from a configuration file.

*   **User Interface (View):**
    *   `GameScreen.py`:  The main game screen.  Handles drawing the grid, flowers, UI elements, and player interaction.
    *   `MainMenu.py`: The main menu screen.
    *   `OrderUI.py`: UI element to display the current order's requirements.
    *   `InventoryUI.py`: UI element to display the player's inventory of flowers and tools.
    *   `ScoreUI.py`: UI element to display the player's score.
    *   `SettingsMenu.py`: Screen to adjust game settings.

*   **Controller:**
    *   `InputHandler.py`:  Handles user input events (mouse clicks, touch events).  Translates these events into game actions.

*   **Data Management:**
    *   `LevelData.py`:  (Could be JSON or other format) Contains level definitions, including grid size, starting flowers, order requirements, etc.
    *   `FlowerData.py`: (Could be JSON or other format) Contains information about each flower type (color, size, visual asset, potential bloom level).
    *   `SaveGame.py`: Handles saving and loading game progress.

*   **Utilities:**
    *   `Utils.py`:  Contains helper functions, such as math functions (e.g., for symmetry checks), color conversions, and random number generation.

**3. Game Mechanics and Implementation:**

*   **Flower Placement:**
    *   The player drags and drops flowers from an inventory/palette onto the grid.
    *   Implementation: The `InputHandler` detects the drag-and-drop event.  It calls the `Grid.isValidMove()` function to check if the placement is valid. If valid, the `Grid.placeFlower()` function is called to place the flower on the grid.
*   **Flower Rotation:**
    *   The player can rotate flowers before placing them on the grid (e.g., using right-click or a rotation button).
    *   Implementation: The `InputHandler` detects the rotation input. It updates the `flower.rotation` value in the `Flower` class, which the View will use to rotate the flower's visual asset.
*   **Bloom Potential:**
    *   Some flowers may have a "bloom potential" -  adjacent placement of certain colors/types could trigger a bonus or a bloom effect, increasing their value.
    *   Implementation:  The `calculateScore()` function in `GameManager` will check for adjacent flowers.  If a bloom condition is met, the score is increased and the flower's `bloom_level` may be incremented.  This will be visually indicated in the View (e.g., with a particle effect).
*   **Order Fulfillment:**
    *   The player must meet specific order requirements, such as having a certain number of flowers of a particular color, size, or arrangement.
    *   Implementation: The `GameManager.isOrderComplete()` function checks if the grid configuration meets all the requirements specified in the `current_order.requirements` dictionary.  This may involve iterating through the grid and counting flower types, checking for symmetry, or calculating the total score.
*   **Scoring:**
    *   The player earns points for placing flowers, fulfilling order requirements, and achieving bonus conditions (e.g., blooms).
    *   Implementation:  The `GameManager.calculateScore()` function calculates the score based on the grid configuration. The score is updated in the `player_score` attribute.
*   **Inventory/Unlocks:**
    *   The player unlocks new flower types, tools (e.g., a "remove flower" tool, or a "swap flowers" tool), and decorative elements by completing orders.
    *   Implementation: When an order is completed, the `GameManager.applyReward()` function applies the reward specified in the `current_order.reward` dictionary. This may involve adding new flower types to the `player_inventory`.  The `InventoryUI` will be updated to reflect the new inventory.
*   **Game Modes:**
    *   **Zen Mode:** No time limit, relaxed gameplay.
    *   **Challenge Mode:** Timed orders, scoring multipliers, and potentially more complex order requirements.
    *   Implementation:  The game mode is selected at the main menu.  Based on the selection, the `GameManager` will either disable the timer (Zen mode) or enable the timer and scoring multipliers (Challenge mode).

**4. Dependencies Needed:**

*   **Game Engine/Framework:**  Choose one that suits your team's experience.
    *   **Pygame:**  A good option for 2D games in Python.  Simple and widely used.
    *   **Unity:**  Powerful and versatile, suitable for both 2D and 3D games.  Has a strong asset store.
    *   **Godot Engine:**  Open-source, free, and lightweight.  Good for 2D games.
    *   **Phaser:**  A popular JavaScript framework for browser-based games.
*   **Graphics Library:**  (If using Pygame or a similar framework)
    *   PIL (Pillow): For image manipulation.
*   **Audio Library:**  (If not included in the game engine)
    *   Pygame's mixer module.
    *   FMOD or Wwise (for more advanced audio features).
*   **UI Library:** (Optional, but can be helpful)
    *   Pygame GUI (if using Pygame).
